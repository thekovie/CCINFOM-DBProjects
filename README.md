- Register an Asset: Allows users to add new assets to the database.
- Update Asset Information: Enables users to edit and update the information of an existing asset.
- Delete an Asset: Allows users to delete an asset that has not been used, has no activities or rentals associated with it.
- Dispose of an Asset: Enables users to mark an asset as disposed of in the system.
- Record a Donation: Allows users to add new donations to the database.
- Update Donation Information: Enables users to edit and update the information of an existing donation.

*Please note that the application does not allow the deletion of an asset that has already been used, has activities, or rentals associated with it. This is to ensure data integrity and prevent accidental deletion of important information.*
